# 3-5 Exercises - User Input

### Lessons learned in slides 3-3 to 3-5 (specifically in relation to the input programs)
- It is important to put math equations within parentheses when concatenating them to a String so that the numbers don't get added to the String individually.
- Typing "sout" in certain IDEs, such as NetBeans or IntelliJ, acts as a shortcut to add a `System.out.println()` statement.
- You can obtain an integer or floating-point number from a String by parsing it.
- One way of getting input from the user is with a JOptionPane, which opens a new window with a prompt. There are various ways you can customize the JOptionPane, such as changing it so the user must pick a specific option from a list, or by removing the prompt altogether and simply displaying a message.
- Another way of receiving user input is with a Scanner, which waits and looks for input directly from the console. It searches the user's input for tokens, separated by a delimiter character, and then the program can get specific data types from each token. Scanners can also read data from files.
